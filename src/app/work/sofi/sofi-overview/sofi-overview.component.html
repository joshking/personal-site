				I've never been on the hook for getting a project done in time for a Super Bowl before. That was probably my favorite memory working there. We were under a deadline to get the company's website redesigned up and updated before our Super Bowl commercial. Long hours and a whole lot of stress, but we made it. My personal project was rebuilding the <a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/"> blog section </a> - which was built on a WordPress backend.

				I learned a lot while there. I was introduced to Angular 2 and other javascript libraries like C3 which was built on D3. I was also introduced to Scala, Docker and the Play framework, though I claim very little understanding of.

				Amazing people work at SoFi. I enjoyed working and learning along side very humble and friendly people.
